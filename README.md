The Regolith_Permittivity.m file included in this repository use equations and calculations from the references cited in the article, and generate the plots and figures used throughout the article. 
The X_band_Waveguide_Experiment.m file includes the simulated as well as tested data points that are then generated into plots to visualize the data. 
The X_Band_Dust_Contamination.aedt file is the Ansys HFSS file that was used to inform the simulation results (for both permittivity simulations and surface roughness simulations).
